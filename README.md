Sub Settings
------------------

This displays the settings in the left menu within the Craft Control Panel.

This saves you a click. I missed the drop-down that displayed when you hovered over
the Settings in the top right when the links existed there.

Just install the plugin and it will display the links on the left control panel menu.

Make sure the folder name is subsettings and is placed within the Craft plugins folder
